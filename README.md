# smartball
This program is developped for the open source project Smartball handled by M. sylvain GARNAVAULT.
You can find all about this project by following this link : https://github.com/siteswapjuggler.
As we had to work in a project in the second semester, Universit√© de Caen Normandie linked us (me and and four other students) with him in order to create an interactive program capable of using the smartball via the an Android application.
the project is about :
1 - connecting the app and the Smartball
2 - send bytes frames to the ball.
